```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sand")
```

```{r}
library(sand)
library(igraph)
g <- graph.formula(1-2, 1-3, 2-3, 2-4, 3-5, 4-5, 4-6, 4-7, 5-6, 6-7)
plot(g)
V(g)
E(g)
str(g)
```

Now, make a directed graph:

```{r}
dg <- graph.formula(1-+2, 1-+3, 2++3)
plot(dg)
```

```{r}
dg <- graph.formula(Sam-+Mary, Sam-+Tom, Mary++Tom)
str(dg)
```

```{r}
V(dg)$name <- c("Sam", "Mary", "Tom")
E(dg)
```

Here is the function to work with adjacency matrix from a IGRAPH

```{r}
get.adjacency(g)
```

Compare it with that for a directed graph, which shouldn't be symmetric:

```{r}
get.adjacency(dg)
```
